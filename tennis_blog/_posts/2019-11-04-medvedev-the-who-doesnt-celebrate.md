Daniil Medvedev had a breakthrough season in 2019. The 23 year old Russian started the year ranked 16 in the world but towards the end of the year won 2 Masters titles and made it to the finals of the US Open (where he lost to Nadal) to end the season ranked world number 5.

One interesting thing you’ll notice about Medvedev is his ice-cold demeanor on the tennis court. He rarely reacts negatively or positively to any point he plays or to any outcome of the match. Take a look at his reaction after winning the Shanghai Rolex Masters this year:

This guy just won a Masters title (one of the more prestigious tournaments) and gained $1.4 million in his bank account but he acted like it was just another regular win. That’s quite different from the usual reactions from players who won their tournaments:

Yet Medvedev’s demeanor on the court suggests that winning is routine for him. That it’s not over for him and there are many more titles yet to come his way. I think the tennis world is excited to see how this man progresses with his career.
