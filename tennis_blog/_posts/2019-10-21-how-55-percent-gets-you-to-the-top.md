One of the simplest statistics in tennis is the percentage of points you win. One would think that the top players in the world probably dominate in this statistic, perhaps by winning 70-90% of all the points they play. After all, if you compare it something like school, students probably have to score above 95% in their tests and courses to become the top in their academic class.

It might surprise you that the top tennis players only win **barely** over 50% of all the points they play on average in a season. For example, in 2016 the top 10 tennis players on average won (only) 53.2% of all the points they played (<a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/news/infosys-winning-percentages-july-2016" target="\_blank" >https://www.atptour.com/en/news/infosys-winning-percentages-july-2016 </a>). **These players win almost all their matches despite losing close to half of all of the points they play**.

*How can this be?*

The top tennis players know which points to win or lose that matter the most. Losing a point to be down 0-15 has a much less impact than losing a point to get broken in a service game. Nonetheless, the statistic is still staggering when you think about it.

If you take a look at Novak Djokovic’s meteoric rise to world number one from rank 100+, he had to win 6% more of his points to raise his prize money from $0.3 million to over $10 million. It just goes to show that “global dominance at the elite level of [tennis] is actually built upon razor thin margins that appear when we examine the building blocks of point play.” (<a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/news/infosys-winning-percentages-july-2016" target="\_blank" >https://www.atptour.com/en/news/infosys-winning-percentages-july-2016 </a>)

While I am not saying this is an easy feat to achieve (it must be extraordinarily difficult due to the sheer number of players unable to crack the top rankings), these small marginal improvements have a huge impact on a player’s performance. 

This also means that one does not need to search for perfection in a tennis game. In contrast to, for example, scoring close to perfection in school in order to be a top student - to be a great tennis player you may only need to be “marginally” better than your opponent across the net.

Thinking in this mentality can put a lot of pressure off you during a match. You **CAN** afford to make mistakes! You **CAN** afford to lose points! In fact out of 100 points, you can lose 49 of them (or more) and still be in great shape. 

Overall, you may be surprised that just trying to be 1-5% better may end up granting you some immense results. &#x1F642;
